# Task Summary: Fixing the RSVP Form Component

**Objective:** The primary goal is to fix the multi-step RSVP form component located in `src/app/rsvp/RsvpClientPage.tsx`.

The key tasks are:
1.  **Resolve All Errors:** Eliminate all syntax, linting, and compilation errors in the `RsvpClientPage.tsx` file. The file is currently in a corrupted state with duplicated code blocks that need to be cleaned up.
2.  **Correct State Management:** Ensure React state (`useState`) for form data, current step, and submission status (loading, success, error) is implemented correctly.
3.  **Implement Event Handlers:** Verify that all event handlers for input changes (`handleInputChange`), step navigation (`nextStep`, `prevStep`), and form submission (`handleSubmit`) are working as intended.
4.  **Fix UI Rendering:** Ensure the UI renders correctly for all states:
    *   Each of the 5 form steps.
    *   The success message upon successful submission.
    *   The error message when submission fails.
    *   The loading indicator during submission.
5.  **Verify Form Submission:** The form should send a `POST` request to the `/api/rsvp` endpoint with the correct payload, including all form data and the `inviteCode`.

The desired outcome is a fully functional, error-free RSVP page that provides a smooth user experience for guests.
